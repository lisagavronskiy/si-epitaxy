# Silicon Epitaxy Simulation Project

This project focuses on building silicon (Si) lattices using monolayer growth through **surface kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC)** and analyzing their material properities using **molecular dynamics (MD)**. It includes case studies of Si lattices with varying levels of structural defects and employs computational tools to simulate and analyze these structures at equilibrium and during annealing.

## Project Structure

### Root Directory
- **`si-epitaxy.ipynb`**: The main script for building a silicon lattice (surface kMC).
- **`si-epitaxy-presentation.pptx`**: A PowerPoint presentation containing:
  - Introduction to the topic and motivation for the project.
  - Explanation of coding logic and the choice of simulation tools.
  - Results, discussions, challenges, and limitations of the simulations.

### LAMMPS Folder
Contains input files and scripts used for simulations on a Linux cluster:
- **`8x8x8_full`**: Smaller test case of a defect-free lattice (8x8x8 array).
- **`64x64x64_full`**: Case study of a defect-free silicon lattice with ~4000 unit cells (64x64x64 array).
- **`64x64x64_5defectsperlayer`**: Case study with 5 defects per layer in the silicon lattice with ~4000 unit cells (64x64x64 array).
- **`64x64x64_10defectsperlayer`**: Case study with 10 defects per layer in the silicon lattice with ~4000 unit cells (64x64x64 array).
- **`post_kmc.lammps`**: LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) script used to simulate the equilibration and annealing processes based on MD principles to compute structures and properties of the Si lattices generated using kMC.
- **`run.job`**: Job submission script for running simulations on a Linux cluster.
- **`Si.tersoff`**: Tersoff potential file for modeling silicon interactions.

### Data Processing
- **`dat_file_processing.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook for processing and analyzing the simulation data generated by LAMMPS.

## Workflow
1. **Building Silicon Lattices**:
   - The script `si-epitaxy.ipynb` builds silicon lattices based on monolayer growth.
   - Lattices are generated and converted into LAMMPS input for the following cases:
     - Defect-free (8x8x8 and 64x64x64 arrays).
     - Defective lattices (5 and 10 defects per layer for 64x64x64 arrays).

2. **Simulation on Linux Cluster**:
   - Files from the `LAMMPS` folder are uploaded to a Linux cluster.
   - Simulations are run using LAMMPS with the `post_kmc.lammps` script.
     - The output trajectory files from the annealing, cooling, and second equilibrium stages were not added to the repository due to exceeding GitHub's recommended maximum file size or size limit.
   - Analyses focus on structures and ensemble properties during equilibration and during the annealing process.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Generated data is processed using the `dat_file_processing.ipynb` notebook.
   - Results are extracted and visualized for interpretation.

4. **Presentation**:
   - The PowerPoint file (`si-epitaxy-presentation.pptx`) provides an overview of the project, including:
     - Motivation and introduction to silicon epitaxy.
     - Explanation of methodologies and tools.
     - Results, discussions, and challenges.

Thank you to [PolarBearJ](https://github.com/PolarBearJ) for their extensive knowledge of silicon, which greatly contributed to this project. Their insights and discussions were invaluable. 

And thank you to my professor, Dr. Conrard Giresse Tetsassi Feugmo, and the teaching assistant, Xander Gouws, for teaching me the subject matter on kMC and molecular dynamics. The workflow of the kMC simulation in this project was inspired by their Langmuir adsorption isotherm model.
